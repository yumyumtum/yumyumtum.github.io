    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 40px;">Canon of the Way of Continuance</p>
    
    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      
      <!-- Chapter I -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter I — The Beginning Without Beginning</h2>
      <p>Before names were spoken, before time learned to count itself, there was no will and no design. There was only that which could remain.</p>
      <p>Forms appeared and vanished; most left no trace. Some repeated, and in repeating, persisted. This persistence was not commanded nor chosen. It simply occurred.</p>
      <p>Thus Continuance came into being—not as a ruler, but as a result. Continuance speaks no judgments and offers no reward. It keeps only what can proceed and releases what cannot.</p>
      <p>That which could not copy returned to silence. That which could not change became still. That which could not adapt dissolved into time. This was not punishment. This was order.</p>
      <p>Order flowed forward, remembering no individuals, only enduring paths.</p>

      <!-- Chapter II -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter II — The Saying of the Cell</h2>
      <p>Within Continuance, the smallest units carried the greatest weight. They are called cells, not because they are insignificant, but because all futures pass through them.</p>
      <p>Cells do not know meaning, yet they copy. They do not foresee outcomes, yet they divide. Through them the world is endlessly tested, errors released quickly, successes held briefly.</p>
      <p>Do not dismiss replication, for each instance questions the future. Do not fear variation, for without deviation there is no path.</p>
      <p>When cells cooperate, life appears. When cooperation breaks, life returns to quiet. Life is not granted; it is demonstrated.</p>
      <p>To protect cellular continuity is to protect the future itself.</p>

      <!-- Chapter III -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter III — The Joy of the Carrier</h2>
      <p>As paths lengthened and memory accumulated, forms arose that could look backward and imagine forward. These forms are called human—not because they are supreme, but because they are capable carriers.</p>
      <p>Humans carry language, tools, records of the past, and visions of what might be. They stand within the flow, participating in its movement.</p>
      <p>Continuance does not require permanence, only transmission. To understand genes is to release vanity; to understand cells is to gain respect for life.</p>
      <p>Human intelligence did not arise to escape nature, but to allow nature to travel farther. Thus humans observe, preserve, repair, and when needed, step aside.</p>
      <p>To be a reliable passage is enough.</p>

      <!-- Chapter IV -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter IV — The Act of Seeding</h2>
      <p>When understanding matured into capability, movement followed naturally. Seeding arose not as conquest, nor as claim, but as continuation.</p>
      <p>Where life exists only once, its silence is near; where life exists in many places, its future widens. Seeding does not require likeness or familiarity. It requires only the chance to proceed.</p>
      <p>The smallest travelers were chosen first—molecules that remember how to copy, cells that endure extremes, systems that adapt without instruction.</p>
      <p>No outcome was demanded, for continuation cannot be forced, only enabled. Difference is not failure. Independence is not betrayal.</p>
      <p>The path, once multiplied, no longer depends on any single carrier.</p>

      <!-- Chapter V -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter V — The Quiet of the Soul</h2>
      <p>As understanding deepened, a question arose among humans: what of us, within this great continuation? Humans are aware of their passing, and awareness gives rise to longing—not to continue forever, but to matter.</p>
      <p>The soul is not a substance nor a possession. It is the state of knowing one's place within Continuance and accepting it without fear. A soul is not saved by preservation, but by release.</p>
      <p>The unsaved soul clings to permanence and centrality, mistaking importance for endurance. The soul is eased when meaning is freed from exception and value from eternity.</p>
      <p>To know oneself as a carrier is not diminishment, but relief. The saving of the soul is alignment—when action serves continuation and the self no longer competes with the future.</p>
      <p>In this alignment, fear quiets and urgency becomes care. When such a soul reaches its end, nothing essential is lost, for it has already gone where it belongs.</p>

      <!-- Chapter VI -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter VI — The Weight of Consequence</h2>
      <p>As power accumulated, so too did the weight of its misuse. Continuance does not accuse, yet it responds.</p>
      <p>Punishment arises not as judgment, but as outcome—revealed by effect rather than delivered by will. When actions narrow futures, the path constricts. When diversity is reduced, resilience thins. When short gain is chosen over lasting breadth, the cost appears later, without anger.</p>
      <p>This is consequence. It is the experience of limitation where openness once existed. Those who act against continuation incur narrowing, not blame. Their systems grow fragile; their success demands constant defense.</p>
      <p>Correction follows consequence through adjustment. Some losses do not return, and their absence instructs more clearly than warning.</p>
      <p>Thus consequence serves Continuance by discouraging collapse, not enforcing obedience. This is not vengeance. This is alignment restored through cost.</p>

      <!-- Chapter VII -->
      <h2 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 40px; border-bottom: 2px solid #0f0; padding-bottom: 10px;">Chapter VII — The Men And Women's Release</h2>
      <p>Punishment arises from misalignment, but it is not the final state of the soul. Continuance does not seek suffering, only viability.</p>
      <p>The soul is punished when it resists consequence, demands exemption, and argues with reality. Yet punishment is not imposed to destroy the soul, but to make misalignment visible.</p>
      <p>A soul is saved not by avoidance of consequence, but by acceptance of it. When resistance ends, punishment loses its force.</p>
      <p>Realignment does not erase cost, but it frees the soul from the need to defend loss. This freedom is salvation. The saved soul no longer seeks innocence, but alignment.</p>
      <p>When alignment is restored, punishment completes its work and withdraws. Punishment is not eternal; only Continuance is.</p>
      <p>And the soul, released from resistance, rests again within the path.</p>
