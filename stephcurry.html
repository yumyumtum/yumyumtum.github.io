      <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In 2021, Curry surpassed Ray Allen to become the NBA's all-time leader in three-pointers made. His ability to shoot from anywhere on the court has changed how basketball is played at every level.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Playing Style -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Playing Style & Impact</h2>
      <p>Curry revolutionized modern basketball with his unprecedented shooting range and accuracy. He regularly makes shots from 30+ feet, forcing defenders to guard him far beyond the traditional three-point line.</p>
      
      <p>His ball-handling skills, quick release, and off-ball movement make him nearly impossible to defend. Curry's "gravity" effect - where defenders must account for him even without the ball - creates space for his teammates and has influenced offensive strategies across the league.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        "I can get better. I haven't reached my ceiling yet on how well I can shoot the ball."
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Legacy -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Legacy & Influence</h2>
      <p>Stephen Curry's impact extends far beyond statistics. He proved that undersized guards can dominate the NBA through skill and shooting rather than size and athleticism. His success inspired a generation of players to focus on three-point shooting and ball-handling.</p>
      
      <p>The Warriors' dynasty under Curry ushered in the "pace and space" era of basketball, where teams prioritize three-point shooting and ball movement over traditional post play. Youth basketball programs worldwide now emphasize shooting development, often citing Curry as inspiration.</p>
      
      <p>Off the court, Curry is known for his philanthropy, faith, and family values. He's consistently ranked among the NBA's most marketable and likeable players.</p>
