    <div class="section">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p><strong>Wardell Stephen Curry II</strong> (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the NBA. Widely regarded as the greatest shooter in NBA history and one of the greatest players ever, Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players to take more three-point shots.</p>
      
      <p>Born in Akron, Ohio, Curry grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father, Dell Curry, was a member of the Charlotte Hornets. He attended Charlotte Christian School, where he led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Despite his success, he was not heavily recruited by major college programs due to his slight build and was considered too small to play for a major program.</p>

      <p>Curry played college basketball for Davidson College, where he set the all-time scoring record for Davidson and the Southern Conference, and led the Wildcats to the Elite Eight in 2008. He was selected 7th overall in the 2009 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors.</p>

      <h2>Early Life & College Career</h2>
      
      <h3 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 20px;">Charlotte Christian School</h3>
      <p>Curry played varsity basketball at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference and all-state during his junior and senior years. Despite his impressive high school career, Curry was not heavily recruited by major colleges because of his slender build and relatively small stature for a basketball player.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #0ff; margin-top: 20px;">Davidson College (2006-2009)</h3>
      <p>Curry chose to play for Davidson College, a small liberal arts college in North Carolina. In his freshman season (2006-07), he became the first freshman in Southern Conference history to be named conference Player of the Year.</p>

      <p><strong>2008 NCAA Tournament Run:</strong> In his sophomore season, Curry led Davidson to the Elite Eight, defeating Gonzaga, Georgetown, and Wisconsin along the way. He scored 40 points against Gonzaga and 30 points against Wisconsin, capturing national attention and becoming one of the tournament's breakout stars.</p>

      <p>Curry left Davidson after his junior year as the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,635 points. He graduated from Davidson in 2022, completing his degree in sociology while continuing his NBA career.</p>

    <!-- Playing Style -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Playing Style & Impact</h2>
      <p>Curry revolutionized modern basketball with his unprecedented shooting range and accuracy. He regularly makes shots from 30+ feet, forcing defenders to guard him far beyond the traditional three-point line.</p>
      
      <p>His ball-handling skills, quick release, and off-ball movement make him nearly impossible to defend. Curry's "gravity" effect - where defenders must account for him even without the ball - creates space for his teammates and has influenced offensive strategies across the league.</p>
      
      <div class="quote">
        "I can get better. I haven't reached my ceiling yet on how well I can shoot the ball."

    </div>

    <!-- Legacy -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Legacy & Influence</h2>
      <p>Stephen Curry's impact extends far beyond statistics. He proved that undersized guards can dominate the NBA through skill and shooting rather than size and athleticism. His success inspired a generation of players to focus on three-point shooting and ball-handling.</p>
      
      <p>The Warriors' dynasty under Curry ushered in the "pace and space" era of basketball, where teams prioritize three-point shooting and ball movement over traditional post play. Youth basketball programs worldwide now emphasize shooting development, often citing Curry as inspiration.</p>
      
      <p>Off the court, Curry is known for his philanthropy, faith, and family values. He's consistently ranked among the NBA's most marketable and likeable players.</p>
